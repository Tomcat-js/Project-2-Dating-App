### Brief 
Build a full-stack database backed application

### Features 
* Encripted passwords
* Designed for smartphone
* Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities.
* Tacky colour scheme and fonts 

### Key Challenges 
The biggest challanges for this project were storing and acessing user information in the database. Also encripting the data added more complexity to the project. I originally planned to have a reponsive design but in the end focused on just making it specifically for smartphones.
